# Progress Tracking Implementation Summary

## üéØ What's Been Implemented

We've successfully added a **Know/Don't Know** progress tracking system to your flashcard app with minimal changes. Here's what's new:

### ‚úÖ Backend Changes

1. **New Models** (`models.py`):
   - `StudySession` - Tracks study sessions
   - `CardReview` - Records individual card reviews (Know/Don't Know)
   - `StudyProgress` - Summary of progress for each set

2. **New API Endpoints**:
   - `POST /v1/flashcard-sets/{set_id}/study-session` - Start study session
   - `PATCH /v1/study-session/{session_id}` - End study session
   - `POST /v1/card-review` - Record Know/Don't Know answer
   - `GET /v1/flashcard-sets/{set_id}/progress` - Get progress stats

3. **Database Functions** (`database.py`):
   - `start_study_session()` - Creates new study session
   - `record_card_review()` - Records user answers
   - `get_study_progress()` - Calculates stats

### ‚úÖ Frontend Changes

1. **Enhanced FlashcardSetView**:
   - Auto-starts study session when viewing cards
   - Records response time for each card
   - Shows real-time session stats
   - Buttons now work: "I know this" (green) / "Still learning" (red)
   - Displays overall progress from previous sessions

2. **New API Methods** (`api.js`):
   - `startStudySession()`
   - `recordCardReview()`
   - `getStudyProgress()`

### üìä Data Collected

For each card interaction:
- ‚úÖ **Know/Don't Know** (simple binary choice)
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Response Time** (thinking time)
- üìÖ **When reviewed**
- üîÑ **Session context**

### üéÆ User Experience

1. **Study Flow**:
   ```
   User clicks card ‚Üí Card flips ‚Üí User self-evaluates ‚Üí Clicks Know/Don't Know ‚Üí Auto moves to next card
   ```

2. **Real-time Feedback**:
   - Cards studied in current session
   - Overall progress from past sessions

3. **Minimal Friction**:
   - Only 2 buttons (Know/Don't Know)
   - Buttons disabled until card is flipped
   - Auto-advance to next card
   - No complicated difficulty ratings

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup

You need to create the new tables in your Supabase database. Run this SQL in your Supabase dashboard:

```sql
-- Study sessions table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS study_sessions (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    set_id INTEGER REFERENCES flashcard_sets(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    started_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    ended_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    cards_studied INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    correct_answers INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    total_time_seconds INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Card reviews table  
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS card_reviews (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    card_id INTEGER REFERENCES flashcards(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    session_id INTEGER REFERENCES study_sessions(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    was_correct BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
    response_time_ms INTEGER NOT NULL,
    reviewed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Create indexes for better performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_study_sessions_user_id ON study_sessions(user_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_study_sessions_set_id ON study_sessions(set_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_card_reviews_user_id ON card_reviews(user_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_card_reviews_card_id ON card_reviews(card_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_card_reviews_session_id ON card_reviews(session_id);

-- Enable RLS (Row Level Security) for user data isolation
ALTER TABLE study_sessions ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE card_reviews ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- RLS policies
CREATE POLICY IF NOT EXISTS "Users can only see their own study sessions" ON study_sessions
    FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY IF NOT EXISTS "Users can only see their own card reviews" ON card_reviews
    FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

### 2. Test the Implementation

1. **Start Backend**: `uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000`
2. **Start Frontend**: `npm run dev`
3. **Study a Set**: Click on a flashcard set and start studying
4. **Watch Stats**: See real-time progress tracking in action!

## üìà Future Enhancements

The foundation is now set for:

1. **Spaced Repetition**: Use `was_correct` and `response_time_ms` data
2. **Smart Recommendations**: Suggest which cards to study
3. **Detailed Analytics**: Charts and insights
4. **Achievement System**: Badges and streaks
5. **Study Goals**: Daily/weekly targets

## üß† Algorithm Potential

With the simple Know/Don't Know data, you can build sophisticated features:

- **Review Intervals**: Spaced repetition based on consecutive "knows"
- **Personalized Order**: Show hardest cards first

The beauty is that users only see 2 simple buttons, but you get rich data for smart algorithms!

## ‚ú® What Users Will Notice

- **Faster Study Flow**: No decision fatigue from complex ratings
- **Immediate Progress**: See session stats in real-time
- **Motivation**: Clear progress indicators and improvement tracking
- **Smart Experience**: App learns which cards are harder for them

This implementation provides the foundation for a sophisticated learning system while keeping the user experience simple and fast!
